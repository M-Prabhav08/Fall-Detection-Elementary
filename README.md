# Fall Detection

## Overview

This project implements a very basic fall detection system using the rate of change in acceleration. The system employs LoRa communication to transmit data between devices. The hardware setup includes an Arduino, a Dragon Shield (RadioHead), and an accelerometer. The transceiver sends accelerometer data to a gateway, which processes the data.

## Features

- **Basic Fall Detection**: Detects falls based on the rate of change in acceleration.
- **LoRa Communication**: Utilizes LoRa for long-range, low-power communication between devices.
- **Data Processing**: Transceiver sends accelerometer data to a gateway, which processes it to detect falls.
- **Arduino Integration**: Easy to integrate with Arduino for prototyping and deployment.

## Data Transmission and Processing

- The transceiver attached to the Arduino sends accelerometer data to a gateway using LoRa communication.
- The gateway receives the data and processes it to determine if a fall has occurred.
- If a fall is detected, appropriate actions can be taken, such as sending alerts or logging the event.
